## Introduction

Welcome to Element of Chance, an interactive web application that explores the principles of randomness and probability through engaging simulations. This project is designed for users interested in learning about chance through hands-on experience.

## Table of Contents

## User Experience

### User Stories

- User Goals - The site’s users want to play an online game that has elements of chance.

- Site Owner Goals - The site’s goal is to provide a challenging game with increasing levels of difficulty to entertain online users.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

### Typography

### Imagery

### Wireframes

### Figma/Full color mockup if produced

## Features

### Features Included

1. **Pattern Matching Functionality**: The game determines the outcome based on the player's choice and the computer's choice.
2. **A Limited Number of Tries**: Players can only play up to a maximum number of tries (`maxTries`), which is set to 5.
3. **A Score Tracking System**: Wins, losses, and ties are tracked and displayed on the screen.
4. **The Ability to Play Against the Computer**: The player plays against a randomly chosen move made by the computer.

## Features to be Added

Describe some additional features you could potentially add to the project that would increase user value - could be things linked to technologies not yet covered by the course but would be a benefit to the user for example, the ability to save an article, or add an article to the site, leave a review.

## Testing

### Validation of Code

- No errors were found when passing through the validator site [validator results for index.html](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&useragent=Validator.nu%2FLV+https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fservices&acceptlanguage=&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbraunie999.github.io%2Felement-of-chance%2F)

- No errors were found when passing through the W3C CSS validator [validator results for CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fbraunie999.github.io%2Felement-of-chance%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

Insert screenshots of HTML, CSS and any other code files being tested in the relevant code validator - CSS validator might not validate newer CSS syntax - be careful to read and fully understand why it is giving you an error.

### Lighthouse

You can perform a test of your website for performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO through the google chrome lighthouse test - it is in your Dev tools. Bear in mind that your internet connection speed plays a part in the performance figures obtained. Where it scores low, it will give you suggestions on how to improve the site - read the suggestions and think about how to implement them - it could be a good idea.
Do this for both Desktop and Mobile.

### Wave Webaim - accessibility testing

You can test your site for accessibility through the wave.webaim site - it needs to be deployed in order for it to test it. Fix any errors that it gives

### Manual Testing

You need to perform, and document everything you did to manually test your site.
At a minimum - you need to check every link on every page works as intended.
So that is check every link in the nav bar (do this on every single page because its a link in a different file) and any other links that appear on your site.
Test the responsiveness of the site - you can do this in the dev tools in responsive mode.
You should also load the site once deployed on as many devices you have access to. What is different from one device to the next? why is it different?

Test the user stories that you created earlier in the readme - did you satisfy the goal, how?

To write up the tests you can use a table,

| Feature being tested | Expected Outcome   | Testing Performed  | Actual Outcome     | Result (Pass or fail) |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| enter details here   | enter details here | enter details here | enter details here | enter details here    |

You should have tests for every section of every page.. individually.

## Technologies Used

Detail what technologies you used. So what code languages, what frameworks, libraries, what software did you use to develop the site - Balsamic for your wireframes, Figma for a mockup?

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the settings tab
  - Select the pages link from the setting menu on the left hand side
  - Under the GitHub Pages from the source section drop-down menu, select the master branch
  - One the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Credits

You need to credit where you got anything for your site from.. where are the images from, are they all from the same site? where did you get the content from, if you wrote it yourself, did you fact check anywhere? did you get code from anywhere? if so, it needs to be clearly marked in both the code and the readme.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to graciously and humbly thank my mentor, Matt Bodden, for sharing ideas and tips on how to think like a computer and challenging me to code more logically.
